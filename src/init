# This code might seem meaningless and trivial but it’s absolutely necessary in order to initialize the universe from first principles.

# Line 1 is nothing
# Line 2 is something, 0
# Line 3 is motion, 1

# At this point we have 2 pieces of information, 0 and 1, which enables us to speak of quantity and the notion of 2.
# Remember that there's no reference point for outward facing motion for the first point particle.
# Therefore the notion of 2 must be introduced somewhere between 0 and 1, nothing can exist outside the space between 0 and 1.

# Line 4 is quantity, also known as 2, but we introduce it along with the division operator as being the midpoint between 0 and 1.

# Now that we have 1/2 of 1, it can be deduced that 2=1+1 at the location of 1/2

# This should be all the information needed to create a number line of arbitrary length and rotate it into arbitrary number of dimensions.
# To summarize, we've initialized the notions of nothing, something, motion, quantity, division and addition in a particular order that does not violate first principles.
# When most people speak of the initial condition, they assume all these concepts already exist.



#### The first 5 lines shall be known as the initial condition. #####

# The initial condition is the minimal set of statements (or state transitions) needed to reconstruct all of mathematics and initialize the universe from first principles.
# Starting from first principles, the universe had to of started that way, there are no other possible state transitions.

# Line 6 is 1/4=1/2*1/2 because if we know 2=1+1, and we've already applied 1/2 to 1, then it can automatically be deduced that 1/2 * 1/2 is a valid operation. Thus 1/4=1/2*1/2 is the next state transition. 


# ¼=1/2*1/2 shall be known as the fractal operator or momentum. It's the expansion rate of space. The rate in which space is fractured.
# Technically the universe could leverage a pseudo expansion rate, if there's a need for it, but the actual expansion rate of space is ¼=1/2*1/2

# Line 6:
# 1/4=1/2*1/2

# Line 7:
# 1/16=1/4*1/4
# 1/256=1/16*1/16
# 1/65536=1/256*1/256

# Lines 6, 7 and 8 have a pattern and so line 8 can be written as a condition, the first of its type.
# If the universe has 2 total vectors thus far and we have introduced multiplication then we can do 1/4=1/2*1/2
# If the universe has 4 total vectors then we can do 1/16=1/4*1/4
# If the universe has 16 total vectors then we can do 1/256=1/16*1/16
# If the universe has 256 total vectors then we can do 1/65536=1/256*1/256
# More generally, it's exponential expansion x=x**2
# The pattern or condition is the total number of line segments (vectors) thus far, multiplied by itself.
# This is the max speed that a number line can be extended and the max speed of fractal flow.
# It's also the max possible width of the universe, measured as total number of line segments.

# At this point in the universe, we've managed to create a 2d surface that can be infinitely fractured at an expontential rate of x=x**2 without violating any first principles. What to do next?
