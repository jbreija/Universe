# This code might seem meaningless and trivial but itâ€™s absolutely necessary in order to initialize the universe from first principles.

# Line 1 is nothing
# Line 2 is something, 0
# Line 3 is motion, 1

# At this point we have 2 pieces of information, 0 and 1, which enables us to speak of quantity and the notion of 2.
# Remember that there's no reference point for outward facing motion for the first point particle.
# Therefore the notion of 2 must be introduced somewhere between 0 and 1, nothing can exist outside the space between 0 and 1.

# Line 4 is quantity, also known as 2, but we introduce it along with the division operator as being the midpoint between 0 and 1.

# Now that we have 3 lines of information, we can speak of 3, which we introduce along with addition operator
# Line 5 is 3, which we introduce as 1+2

# At this point, this should be all the information needed to create a number line of arbitrary length and rotate it into arbitrary number of dimensions.
# To summarize, we've initialized the notions of nothing, something, motion, quantity, division and addition in a particular order that does not violate first principles.
# When most people speak of the initial condition, they assume all these concepts already exist.
