# This code might seem meaningless and trivial but it’s absolutely necessary in order to initialize the universe from first principles.

# Line 1 is nothing
# Line 2 is something, 0
# Line 3 is motion, 1

# At this point we have 2 pieces of information, 0 and 1, which enables us to speak of quantity and the notion of 2.
# Remember that there's no reference point for outward facing motion for the first point particle.
# Therefore the notion of 2 must be introduced somewhere between 0 and 1, nothing can exist outside the space between 0 and 1.

# Line 4 is quantity, also known as 2, but we introduce it along with the division operator as being the midpoint between 0 and 1.

# Now that we have 3 lines of information, we can speak of 3, which we introduce along with addition operator
# Line 5 is 3, which we introduce as 1+2

# At this point, this should be all the information needed to create a number line of arbitrary length and rotate it into arbitrary number of dimensions.
# To summarize, we've initialized the notions of nothing, something, motion, quantity, division and addition in a particular order that does not violate first principles.
# When most people speak of the initial condition, they assume all these concepts already exist.



#### The first 5 lines shall be known as the initial condition. #####

# The initial condition is the minimal set of statements (or state transitions) needed to reconstruct all of mathematics and initialize the universe from first principles.
# Starting from first principles, the universe had to of started that way, there are no other possible state transitions.

# Line 6 is the notion of 4, but there are two possible ways of introducing it. In other words, there are two possible valid state transitions.
# 4=3+1
# ¼=1/2*1/2
# Keep in mind that when we speak of “4”, we’re referring to the fact that the universe has 3 vectors in space so far and we’re going to introduce a 4th. 
# We can take 2 existing vectors and divide them in half, resulting in the notion of 4 or we can simply add a 4th vector as 4=3+1.
# I think ¼=1/2*1/2 is the logical choice because 4=3+1 offers nothing new, although it's still a valid choice.

# ¼=1/2*1/2 shall be known as the fractal operator. It's the expansion rate of space. The rate in which space is fractured.
# Technically the universe could leverage a pseudo expansion rate, if there's a need for it, but the actual expansion rate of space is ¼=1/2*1/2

# Line 6:
¼=1/2*1/2


# At this point in the universe, we've managed to create a 2d surface that can be infinitely fractured at a rate of ¼=1/2*1/2 without violating any first principles. What to do next?
# Line 7 is a mystery for now...
