# All the world's laws and religions are in the wrong format. Only a fool would claim a wall of text is divine or intellect. We need to leverage graphs, tables, charts, visualizations etc... where appropriate.
# "The word of god" doesn't make sense. It's like saying the bicycle of god. Do you know how I know that's not the bicycle of god? God doesn't ride bikes. Do you know how I know the bible is not the word of god?
