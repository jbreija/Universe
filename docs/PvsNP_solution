Since weâ€™ve already shown that the max speed a number line can be extended is polynomial time, x**2, this is also the upper complexity bound of all algorithms in the universe.
Thus, all problems in the universe that can be verified in polynomial time can also be solved in polynomial time.
Therefore, P does indeed = NP
However, we already knew that the discovery of all mathematical proofs could be automated just by looking at rules.png.
