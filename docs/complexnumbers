FYI, the entire existence of imaginary numbers (also known as complex numbers) arises when taking the sqrt of negative numbers.

When calculating the volumes of shapes from formulas, sometimes the formulas require taking the sqrt of a negative number. (See Heron of Alexandria calculating a frustum)

But still even to this day, modern mathematicians don't seem to realize that sqrt is not the inverse of x*x.

Sqrt is the process of counting points on a line (always positive), multiplication is the process of adding points to a line.

These are two different things and not inverses of each other. 

Further, division is not the inverse of multiplication. Division is the location of points on a line and subtraction is the motion of points on a line.

There is no process for removing points on a line, that means you messed up and need to start over with a new line, thankfully the whole numbers are infinite.

Complex numbers should be thought of as projections into the space of "nothing" in init.png.

It's like running out of bounds when playing a sporting event, leveraging the out of bounds, then running back in bounds to score points.

Just know that although it's helpful to do this as a human inside the universe, it's not actually needed when rendering the universe from first principles.

This whole topic stems from the confusion that sqrt is not the process of measuring length or removing points from a line, it's the process of counting points on a line which is always positive.
