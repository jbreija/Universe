Apparently, mathematicians want to know if the Riemann zeta function has its real part = ½ when the function = 0. 
It sure does, just look at init.png. Extending a number line requires 2 perpendicular dimensions centered at ½. 
This is an inherent property of all dimensions, complex or not. I think this is just a matter of not realizing all planes are centered at ½ and not 0.
