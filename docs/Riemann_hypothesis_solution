Apparently, mathematicians want to know if the Riemann zeta function has its real part = ½ when the function = 0. 
It sure does, just look at init.png. Extending a number line requires 2 perpendicular dimensions centered at ½. 
This is an inherent property of all dimensions, complex or not. I think this is just a matter of not realizing all planes are centered at ½ and not 0. 

To elaborate on this, in case it’s not clear, the major overlook on the Riemann hypothesis solution is that zero is a space, not a point.
Zero is not a number and there is no point on a number line containing zero.
Rather, all number lines exist within the space of zero and are centered at ½.
Once you realize that zero is a space and not a point, then the solution to the Riemann hypothesis is super obvious.
It’s just a matter of drawing these 4 pieces of information:

0, 1, ½, 2=1+1

I should also mention it's impossible to prove the Riemann hypothesis using equations because the proof is an inherently geometrical topic.
The solution only requires the first 4 states of the universe and the notion of an equation isn't introduced until the 5th state.
I'm bringing this up because mathematicians will continue to be dumbfounded using equations until someone points out that won't work.

Also, btw, I've never spoken a word of math or physics to anyone ever in my life, including now. This repo has no traffic and I'm just out here talking to myself for 14 years.
I tried contacting some people but the repo never showed any traffic.
AFAIK, nobody is listening. I wonder how long it'll take for the rest of mankind to find this repo.
