Apparently, mathematicians want to know if the Riemann zeta function has its real part = ½ when the function = 0. 
It sure does, just look at init.png. Extending a number line requires 2 perpendicular dimensions centered at ½. 
This is an inherent property of all dimensions, complex or not. I think this is just a matter of not realizing all planes are centered at ½ and not 0. 

To elaborate on this, in case it’s not clear, the major overlook on the Riemann hypothesis solution is that zero is a space, not a point.
Zero is not a number and there is no point on a number line containing zero.
Rather, all number lines exist within the space of zero and are centered at ½.
Once you realize that zero is a space and not a point, then the solution to the Riemann hypothesis is super obvious.
It’s just a matter of drawing these 4 pieces of information:

0, 1, ½, 2=1+1
