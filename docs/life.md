The origins of life and the equations of motion.

Life is the oscillation of light over a fixed region of space. Cells, or containerized environments, are needed to keep the region of space fixed. Cells create a pressurized environment which prevents their contents from chaotic spiral that would normally occur outside a cell. 

According to chemical evolution, the first cells began as empty lipid spheres, created from mechanical motion e.g. lipids floating in the ocean form a thin film that folds onto itself. This video does an excellent job of explaining chemical evolution.

Particularly the part around 5:42. It seems a very plausible explanation to me.


Regardless of the mechanical mechanism, we can say the very first cell(s) must have started empty or near empty, and that’s all that’s needed to model life. Consider a lipid sphere suspended in a liquid solution that contains another liquid solution with a basic molecule at its center:

We’re assuming that a basic molecule can be captured during the formation of the lipid sphere. When the lipid film folds over onto itself forming a sphere, there’s statistically a good chance that other molecules can be enclosed.

The oscillation of light in the basic molecule at the center of the lipid sphere, from one end to the other, over a fixed region of space is what it means to be alive. If we want to query a solar system for the total number of active lifeforms then we would check for this condition.

In order to distinguish the basic molecule from the molecules that form the background liquid solution, we can let the basic molecule be any molecule larger than the molecules comprising the background e.g. RNA, DNA, proteins or the molecules of any cellular contents. Basically, any molecule larger than water.

The orientation of the basic molecule eventually becomes fixed due to the mechanical forces of the pressurized cellular environment, thus creating a fixed region of space. Without the cell, the same basic molecule would have a chaotic spiral.


Once the oscillation of light becomes fixed over a region of space, it can overcome the strength of the lipid wall resulting in what we know as binary fission, cell division. The basic molecule can be swapped out for oscillatory motion, or more generally any downstream lifeform e.g. any cellular molecules like RNA, DNA, proteins or even a collection of cells or living organisms like human bodies, fish and plants. Life is the oscillation of light over a fixed region of space and requires a containerized environment to create the necessary mechanical forces to keep the orientation fixed.

Death is the disturbance of the oscillation, usually caused by puncturing the containerized environment or in the case of this video at 4:40, a mechanical shockwave. https://youtu.be/oRmbWj2ZITM?list=PLK5ezgTmEjTSE6DQLj2GIbqqGtw9nqikq&t=280
 
Now we must determine the equations of motion for the contents of a cell and its evolution. It’s a matter of listing all the mechanical forces acting on the basic molecule and determining the relations between them. This shall be our equation for modeling life at all scales. I’ll have to put these matters on hold for now, until I can secure further funding or time to work on this outside of my day job and other financial obligations.
